# Rory's Blog

Welcome, my friends! This is a place to record the computer stuff I learned. The articles will be focus around programming and math, I would like to learn some topics like : Python, JAVA, C++, multi-threading, OPENGL. Theory part is also important, I would like to read more about computer vision amd machine learning.

Hope to share some interesting things with everyone.
